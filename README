NAME
    Perl::Dist - Perl Distribution Creation Toolkit

DESCRIPTION
    The Perl::Dist namespace encompasses creation of pre-packaged, binary
    distributions of Perl, such as executable installers for Win32. While
    initial efforts are targeted at Win32, there is hope that this may
    become a more general support tool for Perl application deployment.

    Packages in this namespace include both "builders" and "distributions".
    Builder packages automate the generation of distributions. Distribution
    packages contain configuration files for a particular builder, extra
    files to be bundled with the pre-packaged binary, and documentation.
    Distribution namespaces are also recommended to consolidate bug
    reporting using http://rt.cpan.org/.

    *Distribution packages should not contain the pre-packaged install files
    themselves.*

    Please note that this module is currently considered experimental, and
    not really suitable for general use.

  BUILDERS
    There is currently only the default builder:

    *   Perl::Dist::Builder -- an alpha version of a distribution builder

  DISTRIBUTIONS
    Currently available distributions include:

    *   Perl::Dist::Vanilla -- an experimental "core Perl" distribution
        intended for distribution developers

    *   Perl::Dist::Strawberry -- a practical Win32 Perl release for
        experienced Perl developers to experiment and test the installation
        of various CPAN modules under Win32 conditions

ROADMAP
    Everything is currently alpha, at best. These packages have been
    released to enable community support in ongoing development.

    Some specific items for development include:

    *   Bug-squashing Win32 compatibility problems in popular modules

    *   Refactoring the initial builder for greater modularity and control
        of the build process

    *   Support for Win32 *.msi installation files instead of standalone
        *.exe installers

    *   Better uninstall support and upgradability
