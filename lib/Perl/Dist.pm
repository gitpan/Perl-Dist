=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist - Perl Distribution Creation Toolkit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<THIS DOCUMENTATION IS CURRENTLY OUT OF DATE>

The Perl::Dist namespace encompasses creation of pre-packaged, binary
distributions of Perl, such as executable installers for Win32.  While initial
efforts are targeted at Win32, there is hope that this may become a more
general support tool for Perl application deployment.

Packages in this namespace include both "builders" and "distributions".
Builder packages automate the generation of distributions.  Distribution
packages contain configuration files for a particular builder, extra files
to be bundled with the pre-packaged binary, and documentation.
Distribution namespaces are also recommended to consolidate bug reporting
using http://rt.cpan.org/.

I<Distribution packages should not contain the pre-packaged install files
themselves.>

B<Please note that this module is currently considered experimental, and
not really suitable for general use>.

=head2 DISTRIBUTIONS

Currently available distributions include:

=over

=item *

L<Perl::Dist::Vanilla> -- an experimental "core Perl" distribution intended
for distribution developers

=item *

L<Perl::Dist::Strawberry> -- a practical Win32 Perl release for
experienced Perl developers to experiment and test the installation of
various CPAN modules under Win32 conditions

=head1 ROADMAP

Everything is currently alpha, at best.  These packages have been released
to enable community support in ongoing development.

Some specific items for development include:

=over

Bug-squashing Win32 compatibility problems in popular modules

=item *

Customisable installation path.

=item *

Support installation paths with spaces and other weird characters.
